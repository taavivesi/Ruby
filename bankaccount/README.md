# Bankaccount

The idea of this program is to analyze your bank statement and give you information back for you.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bankaccount'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install bankaccount

## Usage

Add your own bank statement files to the lib folder and name them money.csv and money2.csv.
Right now the program works for the csv files from swedbank.
The reports should be from this year.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
